Analysis by Maria Dong, PharmD

## Introduction
_covid bg info, stats, hx, etc._

According to the [CDC website](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-guidance-management-patients.html), the average incubation time (meaning the time from exposure to show symptoms) for a COVID patient is 4-5 days. However, this is based only on limited data, given the recent nature of the COVID-19 pandemic. A recent study in [Science Advances](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/33/eabc1202) by Qin et al features the largest sample size so far in studies of its kind, and estimates that the median incubation time is actually closer to **7.76 days**.

Data for this analysis was pulled from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/covid19-in-usa?select=us_states_covid19_daily.csv) and was cross-checked with data from [Johns Hopkins](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/region/us/georgia) and the [Georgia DPH](https://dph.georgia.gov/covid-19-daily-status-report).
